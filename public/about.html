            <article class="about-jc">
              "Juancarlos Villamil is a __, Columbia born entrepreneur, environmentalist, and investor in the future of our next generation that found 
              himself in Houston, TX in ____. It was here began to pick up a hobby turned into a career and way af life. His passion for skateboarding 
              forever shaped his life  from his days riding around in the local parks to a earning his spot as a professional skateboarder to a fateful 
              injury that took him out of the sport forever.
              <br><br>
              It was a long road to become the compassionate, genuine man he is now. It took a lot of falling and getting back up but every bit of his 
              story paved the way to a new way of life. His story lead to him being known as a pillar of the community and is known as the most genuine 
              person you'll ever meet by all that have had the pleasure of getting to know him. 
              <br><br>
              He worked hard since he was a kid back in Columbia which lead to become asuccessful businessman that earned his place. Jauancarlos is owner 
              of the incredible, authentic local restaurant hotspot for the best Columbian-style rotisserie chicken in the city, Pollo Riko. He literally 
              earned his spot at the table. But his greatest passion of all these days is giving back to the community. The more we take care of ourselves 
              the more we have more to give to help our community.He spends every minute of his day on a full schedule of bettering himself and using that strength to being present
              So if he's not in Dharma class or practicing mindfulness,  as a mentor to countless 
              individuals he still takes the time out his busy schedule to meet face-to face with people to offer support and share in his success.
              <br><br>
              He learned the along the way that success is not defined by a moment, or even a period of your life; instead it is perpetually doing your best 
              to set your sight on your goals even though you know you will stumble and fall along the way. For Juancarlos, he fought through many heavy blows 
              just like the rest of us and we all have to rise to the challenge, look at yourself in the mirror, and conquer all of the tests life throw our  show your character we all have to rise to the challenge
              locally and no matter how big or small the impact may be it spreads like roots of a tree, branching out into the universe
              As Juancarlos often says, "Once a skateboarder, always a skateboarder" which reflects his attitude and passion he now has for a new life he
              built from the ground up."
